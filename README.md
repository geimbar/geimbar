- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @geimbar, a long time .NET developer during the daytime - working on various business oriented software projects in all kind of roles.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in this and that, dependent on the focus at that moment. Have been doing a lot of learning on .NET Core over the years, and testing my projects on Mac, Linux and RasberryPi. Over a period of years I did publish few version of an iOS app that worked on public Instagram feeds, used that to teach my self Objective C and Swift.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter, with the aim of using it for developing a web-based/app solution offer for house and property maintenance.
